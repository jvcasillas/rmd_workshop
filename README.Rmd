output: github_document

In this workshop participants will learn how to use R Markdown and knitr to produce literate documents, i.e., documents that combine both narrative text and code. 
We will focus on learning best practices to ensure our analyses are shareable, efficient, and reproducible. 
Though the focus will be on scientific articles, we will also learn about how R Markdown can be used to generate static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, Beamer, HTML5 slides, Tufte-style handouts, books, dashboards, shiny applications, and websites. 
No prior experience is needed. 
Participants should have a working version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) installed.
